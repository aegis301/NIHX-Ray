# NIHX-Ray

This project is my approach of developing a image classificator based on the NIH Chest X Ray Dataset hostet on (kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data].

## Data
Running the code expects you to have reordered the images into an `images/` folder and will reorder it again into a format where there are seperate folders for trainin, validation and testing. This code is commented out in the original notebook since it is computational very heavy and only has to be done on the first run.
